GAME RULES
- First click "Game Settings" and input a winning score
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of their ROUND score is lost. Then, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the winning score wins the game
